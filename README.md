# Bundle Sample

Here is what I think a bundle should look like.

It'll simple be a zip file with configs in it for now. However, it is extensible that we can create more types of bundles with other kinds of content in them.

Two entries:

- The bundle in it's zipped form. 
- The bundle in it's unzipped form for ease of viewing.
